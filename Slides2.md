# Information Hiding
## Modularization 
* Technique to improve software's ease of change
* A module is a work assignment; a modular structure is the decomposition of a program into modules for parallel work assignments for different teams
## Information Hiding
* A principle for breaking a program into modules
* “Design decisions that are likely to change independently should be secrets of separate modules.”
* “The only assumptions that should appear in the interfaces between modules are those that are considered unlikely to change.”
* When information hiding is achieved, anticipated changes affect modules in an isolated and independent way
