# Design Patterns
## Factory Design Pattern
* Uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created.
* Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses
## Abstract Factory Design Pattern
*  Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes
