# Testing
* Unit testing is the execution of a complete class, routine, or small program or team of programmers
* Component testing is the execution of a class, package, small program, or other program element
* Integration testing is the combined execution of two or more classes, packages, components, or subsystems
* System testing is the execution of the software in its final configuration, including integration with other software and hardware systems
* Regression testing is the repetition of previously executed test cases for the purpose of finding defects
#### Further Testing Classification
* Black-box testing refers to tests in which the test cannot see the inner workings of the item being tested
* White-box testing refers to tests in which the tester is aware of the inner workings of the item being tested
## Test Adequacy Criteria
* Problems:
  1. Developers may not write enough tests
  2. Developers may write many redundant tests, causing quality assurance overhead
  3. During software evolution, we donâ€™t have time to retest everything. Identifying relevant tests (relevant to code changes) is difficult
### Test Coverage
* Statement coverage: How many statements are exercised by tests? 
  * Has each statement been executed? 
* Branch coverage: How many of possible branch evaluations are exercised by tests? 
  * Has each control structure evaluated both true and false?
* Path coverage: How many of possible paths are exercised by tests? 
  * Has every possible route been executed? 
## JUNIT
* Automated unit testing framework
* Provides the required environment for the component
* Executes the individual services of the component
* Compared the observed program state with the expected program state
* Reports any deviation from the expectations
* Does all of this automatically
### JUNIT Test Cases
* Each test case is realized by its own class derived from JUNIT TestCase class
* Each test of the test case is realized by its own method whose name starts with `test...`
* `assertTrue()` method inherited from `TestCase` has the same meaning as `assert
### Validating Program States
* Assertions (JDK 1.4 and later)
#### `assert(b)`
* If `b` is true, nothing happens
* If `b` is false, a runtime error occurs
* Raise `AssertionError` exception
* C and C++ have similar `abort()`
### Executing Component Tests
* If a test fails, the subsequent test cases are no longer executed
* One should be able to run tests individually, independent of other test cases
* One should be able to group tests into test suites
* One should be able to grasp immediately whether tests have failed and if so, which ones
